# Frontend Mentor - GitHub user search app

![Design preview for the GitHub user search app coding challenge](./src/assets/preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

This is a solution to the [GitHub user search app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

The GitHub users API endpoint is `https://api.github.com/users/:username`. So, if you wanted to search for the Octocat profile, you'd be able to make a request to `https://api.github.com/users/octocat`.

### Expected behaviour

- On first load, show the profile information for Octocat.
- Display an error message (as shown in the design) if no user is found when a new search is made.
- If a GitHub user hasn't added their name, show their username where the name would be without the `@` symbol and again below with the `@` symbol.
- If a GitHub user's bio is empty, show the text "This profile has no bio" with transparency added (as shown in the design). The lorem ipsum text in the designs shows how the bio should look when it is present.
- If any of the location, website, twitter, or company properties are empty, show the text "Not Available" with transparency added (as shown in the design).
- Website, twitter, and company information should all be links to those resaources. For the company link, it should remove the `@` symbol and link to the company page on GitHub. For Octocat, with `@github` being returned for the company, this would lead to a URL of `https://github.com/github`.

## Where to find everything

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The assets are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some images are reusable at multiple screen sizes. So if you don't see an image in a specific folder, it will typically be in another folder for that page.

The design system in the design file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Separate the `starter-code` from the rest of this project and rename it to something meaningful for you. Initialize the codebase as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/). **⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️: There are already a couple of `.gitignore` files in this project. Please do not remove them or change the content of the files. If you create a brand new project, please use the `.gitignore` files provided in your new codebase. This is to avoid the accidental upload of the design files to GitHub. With these premium challenges, please be sure not to share the design files in your GitHub repo. Thanks!**
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers. [Read more about our recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).

## Submitting your solution

Submit your solution on the platform for the rest of the community to see. Follow our ["Complete guide to submitting solutions"](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248) for tips on how to do this.

## Sharing your solution

There are multiple places you can share your solution:

1. Share your solution page in the **#finished-projects** channel of the [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack).
2. Tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor**, including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.
3. Share your solution on other social channels like LinkedIn.
4. Blog about your experience building your project. Writing about your workflow, technical choices, and talking through your code is a brilliant way to reinforce what you've learned. Great platforms to write on are [dev.to](https://dev.to/), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), and [CodeNewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/).

We provide templates to help you share your solution once you've submitted it on the platform. Please do edit them and include specific questions when you're looking for feedback.

The more specific you are with your questions the more likely it is that another member of the community will give you feedback.

**Have fun building!** 🚀
